        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nasi goreng is a Southeast Asian fried rice dish, usually cooked with pieces of meat and vegetables. One of Indonesia's national dishes, it is also eaten in Malay-speaking communities in countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and has gained popularity in Sri Lanka</p>
        <p>Nasi goreng has long been considered an important staple of Indonesian cuisine.[6] In 2018, it was officially recognized by the Indonesian government as one of the country's five national dishes.[1] A ubiquitous meal throughout Indonesia, particularly for breakfast, it can be enjoyed in simple versions from a tin plate at a roadside food stall, eaten on porcelain in restaurants, or collected from the buffet tables at dinner parties in urban cities like Jakarta.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>here's the steps of making nasi goreng</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Coat with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour eggs into the hot skillet and cook until the edges begin to set. Lift the edges to allow any uncooked egg to flow onto the hot pan, about 1 minute. Flip omelet in one piece and cook until fully set, about 30 seconds. Transfer omelet to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Stir in onion, leek, chile peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken, shrimp, coriander, and cumin; mix well. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, and omelet strips; cook until rice is heated through and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>To cook rice: Bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup white rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread onto a baking sheet, then refrigerate until cold, about 2 hours.</p>
