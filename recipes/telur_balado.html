        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Originated from North Sumatra (Padang or Minang), this humble dish can be easily bought from many street vendors (warung nasi). When I studied abroad, I found a shortcut to make this lovely dish. Serve with hot, steamed rice or Indonesian fried rice (nasi goreng) with prawn crackers on the side</p>
